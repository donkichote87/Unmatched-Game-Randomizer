# Unmatched-Game-Randomizer
Basic JavaScript project to randomize games from Unmatched Game System (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295564/unmatched-game-system)

It communicates with my REST API (https://github.com/donkichote87/UnmatchedGamesAPI).

Main functionality of the app is randomply picking characters to play with after choosing wich specific games and expansion you have/prefer.
In the future I plan to also add option to randomly pick map (after adding maps to API), choosing starting player and maybe adding some pictures of fighters.
Ultimately I plan to recreate this project with React to train it a little bit.

You can try it on Netlify: https://main--luminous-jalebi-14b306.netlify.app/

Neon stylistic doesn't have anything to do with Unmatched Game... it just looks cool ;)

I don't own Unmatched franchise and this API was not made for any commercial purpose, just simply for training and using it myself
